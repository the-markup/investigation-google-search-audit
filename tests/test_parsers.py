"""
This script is an abstract test for HTML parsers.
Use it for two reasons:
1. Checking if Google has made changes to search results.
2. Assuring parsers are still mostly working.

It is OK if some tests fail, it just means that the specific parser's
target was not in the input dataset.

This code ships with a default dataset. 
You can include an extra parameter of a directory with new HTML files to test.
